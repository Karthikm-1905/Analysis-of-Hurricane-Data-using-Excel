# Analysis-of-Hurricane-Data-using-Excel
## Overview-
This project explores hurricane data through various analytical techniques and visualizations. Using Excel, we analyzed and visualized hurricane patterns, intensity, and impact across different regions and time frames. Key insights include hurricane frequency by month, intensity categorization, central pressure versus maximum wind speed relationships, and state-wise occurrence frequencies.

# Project Structure- 
The analysis includes the following sections:
1. Monthly Hurricane Frequency - Visualizes the number of hurricanes each month.
2. Hurricane Intensity Categories - Displays the frequency of hurricanes by their highest recorded category.
3. Central Pressure and Max Wind Statistics - Provides the range, mean, and median of central pressure and maximum winds.
4. Pressure vs. Wind Speed Relationship - Examines the correlation between central pressure and maximum wind speeds.
5. State-wise Hurricane Frequency - Analyzes hurricane occurrence frequency across various U.S. states.

# Data Source-
The data is sourced from Hurricanes Data Set.

# Visualizations-
Each analysis step includes corresponding visualizations, making trends and relationships within the data more interpretable.

# Requirements-
Microsoft Excel

# Usage-
Download the project files and open them in Excel to view the data, analyses, and visualizations.
